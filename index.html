    <h3>My Journey Begins Here</h3>

    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p>
        This is the first paragraph where I introduce the purpose of the webpage.
        I'm learning web development, and this webpage is my first step.
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    <p>
        The goal of this page is to show how HTML works, including headings, paragraphs, and images.
        HTML is the building block for every website you see online.
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
    <p>
        In this exercise, I will add headings at different levels, at least four paragraphs,
        and a clickable image that links to an external website.
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
    <p>
        Web development is fun and essential for creating interactive, dynamic content on the internet.
        I hope to explore more as I continue learning.
